# üìä Data Lakehouse Pipeline with MinIO, Pandas & Superset

The project implements a comprehensive, production-ready data engineering pipeline that transforms Brazilian e-commerce data into actionable business intelligence. Built with industry-standard practices and modern technologies, the system demonstrates a complete data lifecycle from ingestion to visualization.

This project applies knowledge from AIDE's "Basic Data Engineering" course. Sincere thanks to Mr. Nguyen Thanh Binh and Mr. Hung Le for their guidance.

## Built With

- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** - Containerizes each component of the pipeline, ensuring consistent environments and easy deployment.

- **[Dagster](https://dagster.io/)** - Orchestrates and schedules the end-to-end ETL workflows, from extraction through to loading.

- **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)** - Handles in-memory data cleaning and transformation between the Bronze and Silver layers.

- **[MinIO](https://min.io/)** - Provides an S3-compatible object store for archiving raw and intermediate datasets.

- **[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)** - acts as the staging database where raw CSV data is first ingested.

- **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)** - Serves as the Gold-layer data warehouse optimized for analytical queries.

- **[Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/)** - Offers an interactive BI interface for building dashboards and visualizing the Gold-layer data.
